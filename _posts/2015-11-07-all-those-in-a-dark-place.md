# To all those in a dark place

I used to envy actors, but I soon realised it wasn’t their lives that I desired, only the lives of the characters they portrayed. We are all actors in some kind of way. But we are also directors of our lives, we write the script and choose its direction. Maybe it is easy to forget that. 
As human beings, gifted with free-will, we have this great power over our circumstances, and this is frightening. As I once heard said: « It is our light and not our darkness that most frightens us. », starts making sense.

So it’s easy to float in the wind. To surrender your power and become a plastic bag. In a way that’s the easy option. You relinquish all responsibility. « It’s not my fault », you hear them cry. They complain they are unlucky, that chance hasn’t favoured them, that god turned a blind eye on them. Yet they don’t realise that only they let it happen to them. So there is no one here to blame but yourself.

You are here, the result of all your past actions and decisions. Wherever that may be, it was all your doing. Don’t say no opportunities presented themselves to you, as you didn’t present yourself to them. Maybe in your eyes, we weren’t born equal. Well get over it. How can you be ungrateful when you have eyes to see, limbs to move, a brain for your own use? « But I am a little short ». Why do you think that you are short? Only because you let yourself feel small. You let your mind be dictated by things you see in woman magazines, deceived by things that are not what they are. You lose frame, you let yourself be influenced. And now your self-esteem is down the gutter. You are in a dark place.

Well there is hope.

Regain control of your mind. This is the single most important thing.

I used to go through these cycles. First a period of self-improvement and joie de vivre, of well-being and gratitude, moments of clarity and of great motivation. But invariably, these were tempered by equivalent unproductive periods, filled with dark thoughts and solitude. The tipping point would often be the same: after a social gathering that had left me feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled, I would relapse into porn and instant gratification. Ensued by mindless web browsing, movie binging, low moral value, and basically feeling like shit.

It is easy to mistake the symptom as the cause of a problem.  It is also easy to take the easy path. Living a great life is hard. But it is equally easy to send yourself on a good streak. Simple things help, like going for a jog. To me, it is akin to meditation. No music, just the rythm of your exhalations every, three, steps. Just your body and your mind, no distractions. Whatever it is, stop and think. Do not let yourself not think. We all have seeds of greatness within us, but to provide them with a great environment for growth, we must nurtur them by doing the things that matter. The things that matter to us.

Exerting control in this period of history is notoriously hard. Everything demands our attention. The easy path is shown everywhere, in fact you are exhorted to take it. Instant TV, instant Netflix, instant food, instant sex, instant gratification. Pain relief instead of cure. But these things don’t matter. They make us feel good temporarily, but can never satiate us. Short term yes, but long term no. And life is long term.

So don’t live an actor’s life, but become the character you want to be. Listen to your mind, nurtur your seeds. Pause and reflect. Hold frame and be aware of all influences. Regain control of your mind.

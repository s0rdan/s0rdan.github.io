# Mike Mentzer's High-Intensity Training

##The First Principle: Indentity

“A is A” implies causality. Anatomically and physiologically, every human being is essentially the same. Rational training, use logic to gain knowledge. Logic is non-contradictory identification.##The Second Principle: Intensity
High-intensity muscular contraction is the most important requirement for the stimulation of rapid increases in muscular size and strength, whereas the duration of the exercise is not important in this regard.
Intensity is inversely proportional to duration. Attempting that seemingly impossible rep causes the body to dip into its reserve ability, stimulating growth.Intensity is defined as the percentage of momentary ability that an individual is capable of exerting, tending to 100% on the last rep, hence the need to train to failure.
There are **three ways of increasing intensity levels**:
1. By progressively increasing the amount of weight you use.2. By progressively decreasing the amount of time it requires to perform a certain amount of work.
3. By carrying each set to a point of total failure.
There are **three levels of strength**:
1. Full extension to full contraction (weakest), also known as concentric contraction / positive strength.
2. Static strength (stronger).3. Full contraction to full extension (strongest), also known as eccentric contraction / negative strength.True failure occurs when you have exhausted all levels of strength, e.g. doing assisted negatives to failure.

##The Third Principle: Duration

Any exercise carried out beyond the least amount required to stimulate an optimal increase is not merely a waste of effort, it is actually highly counter-productive. The issue of volume is a negative factor. More is not better; less is not better; the precise amount required is best.
The first thing our bodies must attempt to do following a workout is to recover the energy it has lost as a result of the workout. Allow ample time for recuperation. Six days a week, twenty sets per body part is bad. As an analogy, consider the effect of the sun on the skin. A tan is a sign of adaptation, but overexposure will lead to a burn and potentially a stroke. Similarly, there exists such threshold between stimulating maximum growth and overtraining.

##The Fourth Principle: Frequency

Exercise always has a generalised effect of the entire physical system as well as a localised one on specific muscles. An ideal workout should include maximum growth stimulation and utilise a minimum of the body’s biochemical reserves. You must allow 96 to 120 hours (four to five days) for full recovery in between workouts.##The Fith Principle: Specificity
Specific demands imposed upon the body result in specific neurophysiological adjustments to these demands (muscular contraction).
**Four techniques for maximum muscle stimulation**:

1. All exercises to start from pre-stretched position (triggers myotatic reflex, maximum contraction).
2. Exercises to be performed at a relatively slow rate of speed (no sudden thrust, no momentum).3. Range of movement should be as great as possible.4. Resistance must be sufficient to cause maximum contraction.
A barbell offers very little to no resistance at the top of the movement.

##The Sixth Principle: Adaptation

If human muscle (Identity) only grows larger and larger through the application of the proper training protocol (Specificity) of high-intensity training (Intensity), and such training in order to be high-intensity in nature cannot be endured for long (Duration) or engaged in very often (Frequency), it will lead to the body adjusting itself to the stress of the imposed training stress by a process of adaptation (Adaptation) by enlarging its existing store of muscle mass.
The General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) is made up of three parts: alarm reaction, resistance and exhaustion. The first results into muscular soreness. From the second, no more than two workouts per week and two sets per body part, going to complete failure on each and every set (\\(\rightarrow\\) 100% effort on the last reps). Reaching the limits of our muscular potential requires that we increase the intensity of our training method notch by notch until we reach our limits of adaptation.##The Seventh Principle: Progression
If you want your muscles to grow progressively larger and stronger, then something about your workouts must progressively increase (not duration but intensity). Weight can increase, the distance (range of motion) remains fixed and rest time in between sets can decrease. The sets must remain slow or momentum destroys intensity. Rest must be short but not too short — cardiovascular failure must be avoided. Strength increases come first, then size.##A Compendium of High-Intensity Training ExercisesCarrying a set to a point of momentary muscular failure ensures that you pass through the break-over point: the level of effort in the set at which growth stimulation commences. Select a weight in each exercise that will allow approximately six reps in strict form.
Pre-Exhaustion: It is impossible to reach failure in exercises involving more than two muscles when one of these is a so called weak-link (e.g. chest and triceps, back and biceps). You must first perform an exercise that isolates and tires the primary muscle group to failure, then move on to the next exercise with virtually no rest. Select one exercise per body part that offers resistance at the top of the movement (peak contraction).Advanced techniques include: forced reps (with training partner), negative reps, rest pause training, partial reps, static contraction.
The drawback in barbells lay in exercises where you can lock out and hold the weight in the peak con- tracted position. They offer no resistance to force contraction and thus limited growth and stimulation. Resistance would ideally always be opposing the motion (some machines). However, both free weights and machines should be used in your training.##The Ideal (Principled) WorkoutAn ideal routine would: 1. Induce maximum possible growth stimulation 2. Use up a minimum of the body’s recuperative capacities. Make unceasing efforts towards reducing working out time to 10-12 minutes. Rest 4-7 days after performing each of these workouts. An indicative tempo of 4/2/4 should be followed.

##Further Comments

* Wait one extra day if you cannot exercise on the designated date.* Only one set per exercise, less is more.* Do not rest between exercises in the pre-exhaust cycle.* Never allow the workout to degenerate into a race against the clock.* Never terminate a set, because the prescribed number of repetitions has been reached, always go to failure.* Perform the minimal amount of exercise required to achieve an actual warm-up. 7-10 easy reps using the main exercise of each pre-exhaust cycles.* Keep a record of all workouts (exercises, reps, weight) in a physical diary.* A slowdown in progress indicates overtraining. At first sign, stop training for two weeks so that the body may fully recover. Upon resumption, eliminate / substitute a demanding exercise and allow one to two more days in between workouts.
